        Luxor is a city on the east bank of the Nile River in southern Egypt. 
        It\'s on the site of ancient Thebes, the pharaohs\’ capital at the height of their power, 
        during the 16th–11th centuries B.C.\n\nToday\'s city surrounds 2 huge, surviving
        ancient monuments: graceful Luxor Temple and Karnak Temple,
        a mile north. The royal tombs of the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens are on the river’s west bank.

    <string name="karnak_info">
        Known as Ipet-isut by the ancient Egyptians, the Temple of Karnak is in fact a whole city of
        temples that were constructed over two millennia ago and were originally made
        in tribute to the Theben triad of Amon, Mut and Khonsu.\n\n
        Within easy reach of central Luxor, this entire ancient city covers some 200 acres / 120 hectares, with the
        many attractions at the Amon enclosure alone covering a massive 60 acres / 36 hectares.\n\nThe biggest
        temple at the heart of the city is awesome and so big
        that the cathedrals of Notre Dame, St. Peter\'s and Milan would be lost within its
        spacious confines.\n\nThe 54,000 square-foot Hypostyle Hall has a total of 134 columns
        and is hailed as the largest room within a religious building anywhere in the world.
    </string>

    <string name="luxor_info">
        The Temple of Luxor was built largely by King Ramesses II and King Amenhotep III and was
        constructed with the intention of being the focal point of the city\'s most popular festival,
        known as the Festival of Opet.\n\nThis grand temple is a magnificent structure with many
        separate sections, each of which was designed with a specific purpose in mind with regards to the festival.\n\n
        Some of the most famous buildings and attractions include the Pylons, Court of Ramesses II,
        Mosque of Abu\'l Haggag and the Court of Amenhotep II.
    </string>

    <string name="setti_info">
        Luxor\'s Temple of the Seti 1 was once one of the biggest temples in Thebes and although
        much of the original structure no longer remains, those parts that are still standing
        are certainly worth viewing.\n\nThe temple dates back to the 13th century and contains many
        interesting stone carvings with depictions that pay homage
        to Amon, Mut and Khonsu.
    </string>

    <string name="merneptah_info">
        The original Mortuary Temple of Merneptah was all but destroyed.\n\n
        However it has been faithfully reconstructed and is now one of the newest sights of interest
        on Luxor\'s West Bank.\n\nWhile many of the interior details (such as wall reliefs) that one would
        expect to find in a temple of this nature are not evident, the construction offers a highly accurate
        impression of the exterior and interior architectural features of a 19th Dynasty funerary compound.

    <!-- Landmarks Info strings-->
    <string name="sphinxes_info">
        The remains of these historic sphinxes make some interesting
        monumental sights that provide good photo opportunities for enthusiastic tourists visiting Luxor.\n\nStretching
        about 3 km / 2 miles, the Avenue of the Sphinxes is the remains of a walkway that once connected
        the temples of Luxor and Karnak, and was home to a number of human-headed sphinxes.\n\nThe walkway\'s main
        purpose was to facilitate the movement of the images of Amon, Mut and Khonsu which
        were carried between the two temples in a once yearly festival.
    </string>

    <string name="memnon_info">
        Located on the west bank of Luxor, about half a kilometre east of the Antiquities
        Inspectorate, the Colossi of Memnon are two giant sandstone statues standing 23 metres / 75 feet high.\n\n
        A temple originally stood on the same site and the Colossi were built as its guardians.\n\n
        The characters of the statues are seated on huge granite plinths and these local landmarks look quite magnificent
        looming over what is now a busy road.\n\n
        Some other remains can be found in the same area, among which are two headless sphinxes.
    </string>

    <string name="kings_valley_info">
        While the Valley of the Kings is considerably less grand than the Pyramids in terms of Egyptian funerary complexes,
        it is still well worth a visit and is amongst Luxor\'s most-visited tourist attractions.\n\n
        The Valley of the Kings illustrates some aspects of the Egyptian concept of the afterlife that the Pyramids do
        not.\n\nSome 30 to 40 tombs are open for visitor exploration, although it would be highly ambitious to
        expect to see so many and taking a look around five is usually sufficient for most tourists.\n\n
        Among the more popular tombs are those of Ramesses IV, Ramesses IX, Merneptah and Ramesses VI.
    </string>

    <string name="deir_medina_info">
        Otherwise known as the Artisan Village, Deir el-Medina is close to central Luxor and is the remains of
        an old Egyptian township that was previously inhabited by various craftsmen following its founding by TuthmoseI.\n\n
        The craftspeople who called this town home were responsible for decorating the tombs in the Valley of the Kings.\n\n
        Little or nothing is left of the original town except the stone walls which ran its perimeter
        and marked out streets and houses.\n\nAttractions at Deir el-Medina include two tombs within the
        town, which house the remains of some of the workers and also contain some interesting wall paintings.
